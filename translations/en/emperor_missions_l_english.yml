If we were to draft a new primissione ducale, one that more firmly restates our values and the roles envisioned for the Doge, not only would our government be strengthened, but more virtuous candidates for office might step forward as well."

 emp_ven_contest_genoese_trade_desc: "Genoa has long been a thorn in our side, and the growing power of Western Mediterranean trade is simply strengthening their hand and making them more of a threat to us. We must do something about their sources of trade- if we can cut into their income, they won't be nearly wealthy enough to seriously contest our power, and that will enable us to humiliate them further."
 emp_ven_the_francocracy_title: "The Francocracy"
 emp_ven_the_francocracy_desc: "Following the Fourth Crusade, we established several lordships in former Byzantine lands, and for a while helped maintain their presence in the region. The Greeks denigrated these realms as the 'Frankokratia', the rule of the 'Franks', but for us they were useful tools for extending our power. It was a grand time to be a Venetian. The time is ripe to re-establish our presence in Constantinople, the real center of power in the area, but this time we should play a more active role in the region's administration."

 emp_ven_challenge_papal_supremacy_desc: "We have long maintained a certain understanding with the Papacy. The Pope would not meddle in the affairs of our churchmen, and we would not meddle in the affairs of the Pope. These days, however, the Papacy has grown more assertive, even as our own power grows, and has begun involving itself in Church affairs across Europe. It is time for us to remind the Pope of our old arrangement, and check the Papacy's grasps at power."
