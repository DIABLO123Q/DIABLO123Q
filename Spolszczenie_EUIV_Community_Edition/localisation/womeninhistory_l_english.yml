The leader of the English Reformation, the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void, then declared Henry and Anne's marriage to be good and valid. The pope immediately decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer. This resulted in the break between the Church of England and Rome, the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne became pregnant quickly and the future Queen Elizabeth I was born on 7 September, 1533. Disappointed in the gender of the child, and the three miscarriages that followed, Henry started courting Jane Seymour.

Her father regretted abandoning her at the orphanage and they reconciled. When Nora was visiting a city where a pasha resided, the pasha saw her and fell madly in love. He sent a trusted man to Nora's house and asked for her hand, by the laws of the Albanian Kanun, but Nora's family refused, stating that the Albanian Kanun did not allow for marriages with non-Albanians. The pasha did not take this well, unaccustomed with such refusal and raged, "Either Nora will become my wife or I will burn all of Malsia to ashes.". In order to break the siege the pasha had led to her town, Nora devised a plan to kill the pasha. She went to the pasha pretending to want to marry him. After the pasha, joyous with her presence, had sent his troops away she stabbed him with a dagger, kicked him and chocked him so that he could not scream. The pasha did not die, for he fell on the ground and as it is dishonorable for an Albanian to strike a man that is not standing or not fighting back, Nora fled before she could kill him. The Albanian army attacked, and Nora returned with an army of 300 women, killing the pasha in a duel."

So was the case with Lucrezia Borgia, whose father Pope Alexander VI married her to three different men during her life to gain powerful alliances and founding. Her first husband was Giovanni Sforza, Lord of of Pesaro and titled Count of Catignola. He was offered Lucrezia's dowry in return for invalidating the marriage, the Pope claiming that it had not been consummated and should thus be dissolved. The Borgia family had grown so powerful that they no longer needed the Sforzas, and instead sought better alliances. Giovanni first refused, accusing Lucrezia of paternal and fraternal incest, but with the pressure from the rest of the Sforza family he finally agreed to sign confessions of impotence and documents of annulment before witnesses. Alfonso of Aragon married Lucrezia Borgia after the annulment, but the short marriage ended when he was murdered, supposedly by Lucrezia's brother Cesare. Lucrezia was appointed governor of Spoleto not long before her husband's death, and they had a child named Rodrigo of Aragon. Her third and last husband was Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Lucrezia's reputation has taken a hit, with her many different marriages, murdered husband, annulment and the stain that her father and brother had brought upon her. Hopefully, with her marriage to the Duke, she can be known as a respectable and accomplished Renaissance duchess."

The Women's Council of Clan Representatives named her their leader and she became the ambassador and negotiator for her people. From Mrs. Lydia William Bean, who Nanyehi spared when the woman was captured after an attack on Bean's settlement, she was taught a new loom weaving technique after having nursed Bean back to health. The new weaving technique changed the roles of women in the Cherokee society. The men was left to do the planting, traditionally a woman's job, when the women took on the weaving. Two dairy cows were rescued from the destroyed settlement by Mrs. Bean, who then taught Nanyehi to raise the cattle and to eat dairy products. This proved helpful as the dairy could sustain the Cherokee when hunting was bad. Chief Attakullakulla taught Nanyehi the art of diplomacy and she was much surprised when she met European diplomats as there were no women negotiators among them. Their leader was appalled, such important work should not be given to a woman! Nanyehi replied: "You know that women are always looked upon as nothing; but we are your mothers, you are our sons.

The Red Flag Fleet was a coalition of several competing Cantonese pirate fleets gathered by Jihng Yat using military assertion and his reputation. He died in Vietnam and Ching Shih maneuvered her way into his leadership position by cultivating personal relationships.

The first law was that anyone giving their own orders or disobeying those of a superior were beheaded immediately. The second law forbade theft from the public fund or any villagers that supplied the pirates. The third law was that all goods taken as booty had to be presented and registered by a purser and then distributed by the fleet leader. 20 percent was given to the original seizer and the rest was placed in the public fund. The fourth law was that all actual money was to be turned over to the squadron leader and used to purchase supplies for unsuccessful ships.
