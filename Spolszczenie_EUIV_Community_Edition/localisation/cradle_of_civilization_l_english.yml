In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."

This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control.

One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal.
